									<h1>In History</h1>
									<br>
								<br>
									<p>Take a look back into history, there is a lot of phenomenon and record talking about space debris,<br> which may cause serious impact to our life and earth. </p>
								</header>

								<br>
								<h2>Anti-satellite test in India</h2>
								<p>NASA administrator Jim Bridenstine said April 1, 2019 that India's recent anti-satellite test created 60 pieces of orbital debris big enough to track, 24 of which rise higher than the International Space Station's orbit around Earth.</p>
								<br>
								<br>
								<h2>Solid rocket fuel</h2>
								<p>Current solid rocket fuel usually employs significant quantities of aluminum mixed with the propellant to dampen burn rate instabilities. However, during the burning process, large numbers of aluminum oxide particles are formed and ejected through a wide range of flight path angles at velocities up to 4 km/s. These particles are generally believed to be no larger than 10 microns in diameter, but as many as 10^20 may be created during the firing of a single solid rocket : motor, depending on the distribution of sizes produced. While the orbital lifetimes of individual particles are relatively short, a considerable average population is suggested by examinations of impacts on exposed spacecraft surfaces.</p>
								<br>
								<br>
								<h2>The Kessler Syndrome</h2>
								<p>Spent rockets, satellites and other space trash have accumulated in orbit increasing the likelihood of collision with other debris. Unfortunately, collisions create more debris creating a runaway chain reaction of collisions and more debris known as the Kessler Syndrome.<br>This cascade of collisions first came to NASAs attention in the 1970’s when derelict Delta rockets left in orbit began to explode creating shrapnel clouds. Kessler demonstrated that once the amount of debris in a particular orbit reaches critical mass, collision cascading begins even if no more objects are launched into the orbit. Once collisional cascading begins, the risk to satellites and spacecraft increases until the orbit is no longer usable.</p>
								<br>
								<br>
								<h2>2009 February 18 satellite collision</h2>
								<p> a defunct Russian communications satellite named Cosmos 2251 smashed right into an operational US communications satellite named Iridium 33 over Siberia, Russia. Both satellites were destroyed. The sheer number of massive particles in a dispersing debris cloud, increases the risk that other operating satellites might be struck by a harmful fast-moving projectile. The collision occurred in low Earth orbit only 750 kilometers up, a height shared by many satellites but significantly higher than the 350-km high human-occupied International Space Station. Since satellites may disintegrate when struck by fast-moving space junk, the crash focuses concern that a future dramatic satellite collision may one day start an ablation cascade of increasingly more collisions. The result could then render future human space flights increasingly risky and expensive satellite lifetimes increasingly short.</p>

								<br>
								<h2>West Ford needles</h2>
								<p>Fifty years ago, the U.S. attempted to create a short-lived band of hundreds of millions of tiny wires about the Earth to test passive communications techniques. These needle-like wires were sent to the space for acting as dipole reflectors of X-band transmissions.<br>Communications satellites quickly obviated the need for such concepts, but some remnants of the two test missions remain today.Data collected during observations in the mid-1990s suggest that a moderate population of small debris resides in orbits above 2500 km. It has been suggested that these debris represent small clumps of needles from the first Project West Ford mission in 1961.</p>
